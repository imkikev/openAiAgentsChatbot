# OpenAI Agents SDK Chatbot by Kike

This project is a chatbot application powered by OpenAI agents. It includes a backend for managing agents and guardrails, and a frontend built with Streamlit for user interaction. The project also supports testing with `pytest` and uses environment variables for secure configuration.

## ðŸ”§ Powered by OpenAI Agents SDK

This project leverages the [OpenAI Agents SDK](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/), a lightweight and powerful framework for building multi-agent workflows. The SDK simplifies the development of agentic applications by providing:

- **Agents**: LLMs equipped with instructions and tools.
- **Handoffs**: Mechanisms that allow agents to delegate tasks to other agents.
- **Guardrails**: Input validations and checks that run in parallel to agents.
- **Function Tools**: Python functions turned into tools with automatic schema generation and validation.
- **Tracing**: Built-in tracing to visualize and debug agentic flows.

For more details, refer to the [official documentation](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/).

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

## Features

- **Chatbot Interface**: A user-friendly chatbot built with Streamlit.
- **Agent Management**: Backend logic for managing multiple agents, including a triage agent and specialized agents.
- **Guardrails**: Input validation and routing using guardrails.
- **Asynchronous Execution**: Supports asynchronous operations for efficient processing.
- **Testing**: Includes unit tests for backend logic using `pytest` and `pytest-asyncio`.
- **File Retrieval with Vector Store**: Retrieve relevant information from your uploaded documents using OpenAIâ€™s FileSearchTool.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/openAiAgentText.git
   cd openAiAgentText
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create a .env file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key and Vector Store ID::
   ```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   VECTOR_STORE_ID=your_vector_store_id_here
   ```
   - **To obtain a `VECTOR_STORE_ID`, you can:**

   - **Upload files via the OpenAI Platform UI:**
   
      1. Navigate to [OpenAI's platform](https://platform.openai.com/).
      2. Go to the **"Files"** section.      
      3. Create a new vector store and attach your uploaded file.
      4. Retrieve the `VECTOR_STORE_ID` from the vector store details.

   - **Or use the OpenAI CLI:**

      ```bash
      openai file create -p assistants -f my_document.pdf
      openai vector-store create -f <file_id>
      ```   

## Usage

### Run the Chatbot
#### To execute the Chatbot logic:
```bash
python3 -m streamlit run frontend/chatbot_app.py
```
#### To execute the backend logic (optional):
```bash
python3 backend/main.py
```

### Run Tests    
To execute the test suite:
```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/test_main.py
```

To save test results to a file:
```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/test_main.py > test_results.txt
```
